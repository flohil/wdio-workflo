## Introduction

This guide teaches you how to create your own `PageNode` classes and how to add them to a `PageNodeStore`.

It covers extending the base classes `PageElement`, `PageElementList` and `PageElementMap`.
However, it does not show you how to extend a `PageElementGroup` since the need to do so should hardly ever
arise.

All code examples for customizing a `PageNode` class can be found in the [wdio-workflo-example](https://github.com/flohil/wdio-workflo-example) repository.
