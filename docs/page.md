## Overview and Objective

## Location and Naming Convention

Page files are located in the `src/page_objects/pages` folder of your system test
directory. I usually like to name page classes so that they end with the term `Page`,
but from a technical perspective, this is not required and you do not need to follow
this convention.

## Code Example

## Structure

### Typing and Constructor

types of interface and class

### Defining Page Nodes

constructor: define store,

page nodes as getters - and why

### Implementing "LifeCycle" Methods

implementation of isOpen and isClosed

no implicit waiting - happens
on page node level

therefore no currently API, but
wait and eventually

types in class constructor

## Base Page Class

pageName in url

container and heading

isOPen and isClosed
